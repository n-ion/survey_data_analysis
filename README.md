#Simple Survey Response Visualizer

This is a simple python script to help visualise the responses from surveys.

Survey responses often have both single answer fields and multiple answer fields. This script provides two seperate routines to deal with each case.

It produces **pie charts** for the single answer case and **bar charts** for the mulitple answer case.

It uses the numpy, matplotlib and pandas python modules.
